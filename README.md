# ble-client-shara
Repository for the client-side of my final degree project, which consist in a client-server communication using BLE.

In this repository you can find what I've called the "First Module" of the project. In this module you'll find the following scripts which are in charge of the correct functioning of different parts of the server-side of the project.

## BLE-Client

BLE Client to stablish the connection with the clickers.

## Quiz generation

Quiz generation was developed using the OpenAI API. Thus the quiz and also its answers has been generated by entering a PDF document of the user choice.

## Data evaluation

Simple python script with the necessary logic to implement the data evaluation. Data from the clients it's going to be obtained using queues, this is why in the first versions you can see simple scripts generating random queues to perform the calculations.

## Speaker

To allow the part regarding speaking both python libraries gTTS and playsound had been used. The audio was generated using gTTS and played using playsound.
