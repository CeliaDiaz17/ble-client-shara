# ble-server-shara
Repository for the server-side of my final degree project, which consist in a client-server communication using BLE.

The BLE Server part was developed thanks to brunovollmer project, which can be found in this repository: "https://github.com/brunovollmer/pycon_ble_demo/tree/master". This code was adapted in order to fullfill my BLE Server needs.
